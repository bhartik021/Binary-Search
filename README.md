## What is Binary Search?
Binary search is an algorithmic technique that allows efficient searching in sorted arrays or ranges. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target value is found or determined to be not in the array.

Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), making it significantly faster than linear search for large arrays. It is a fundamental algorithm in computer science and is used in a variety of applications, including search engines, compilers, and databases.

## Common Binary Search Patterns
The 8 common binary search patterns provide a framework for approaching and solving binary search problems. They are:

- Basic Binary Search
- Find First Occurrence
- Find Last Occurrence
- Find Smallest Element Greater Than Target
- Find Largest Element Smaller Than Target
- Find First Element Equal to Target
- Find Last Element Equal to Target
- Matrix Binary Search

Each pattern is explained in detail and illustrated with examples in the repository.
